1. download buildroot and unzip it to ~/
2. For some reason, cttyhack is not enabled in busybox by default. we need to change config file to enable it. In the file `path/to/buildroot/package/busybox/busybox.config` there should be the line
```
# CONFIG_CTTYHACK is not set
```

change it to 
```
CONFIG_CTTYHACK=y
```

Also, do this for SETUIDGID as well. 
```
CONFIG_SETUIDGID=y
```

3. `make menuconfig` ->  Enable initramfs, set architecture to x86_64. Also something to be careful is to make sure the kernel toolcahin version adheres to the kernel version. If it doesn't match, you will waste about 10~15 mins, swearing at the failed build after make.


4. `make` buildroot. The `bzImage` and `rootfs.cpio` file will be located at `/path/to/buildroot/output/images`.

5. compile the kernel module. For this, reference the `src/Makefile` file. Make sure you use the makefile in buildroot, not our own linux.

6. Decompress the `rootfs.cpio` file. For this reference the `image/decompress.sh` file. The opposite can be done with `image/compress.sh` script.

7. add the kernel module to initramfs and create an appropriate rcS file
```bash
#!/bin/sh
 
mount -t proc none /proc
mount -t sysfs none /sys
mount -t devtmpfs devtmpfs /dev
chown root:root flag
chmod 400 flag

insmod /lkm_example.ko
echo -e "\nBoot took $(cut -d' ' -f1 /proc/uptime) seconds\n"
setsid cttyhack setuidgid 1000 sh

umount /proc
umount /sys
poweroff -d 0  -f
```

8. Boot via qemu. Argument setting is complicated, so reference `image/boot.sh`.
